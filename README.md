<p>
Welcome to the Telangana Growth Analysis Project! Our mission is to analyze the growth of different sectors in Telangana, India, and provide valuable insights to support data-informed decision-making by the Telangana government.
</p>

<h3 align="left">Objectives</h3>
<p>
The key objectives for this analysis are:
- Explore Stamp Registration, Transportation, and Ts-Ipass Datasets.
- Understand their attributes, categories, and time period.
- Analyze trends and patterns within each department.
- Identify growth opportunities and areas needing attention.
- Find correlations among these departments and report the overall growth of the state through insights and relevant visuals.
